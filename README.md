# React Fundamentals 3/5

## Interacting with a Server

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

This project is set up using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for React and a very simply Express server.

To start React, simply run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

To start the Express server, run the following command in a seperate terminal:

```sh
npm run server
```

The React application should be available on port 5173, and the Express server on port 8080 (though do check the terminal output from above commands).
